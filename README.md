# Arknights Audio
This repo contains audio files from the global version of Arknights, compressed down to mp3s. It's a fork from Aceship's repo (which contains data from the CN version, but not up to date), updated to the current version on global (or as current as the latest commit). 

Note that new files not from Aceship repo at the time of forking use a different compression method which results in a file with smaller bitrate, so the quality might be a mite different. 

This repo is used for educational purpose only. Mainly, I use this for [TLVR](https://github.com/PseudoMon/tlvr-source).  

Only the voices are regularly updated. Player and enemy are occassionally updated. The other directories are remnants from Aceship's repo which I'm not personally updating. If you need any directory updated or you need the lossless wav files for some reason, you can contact me and I might be able to help you out.
